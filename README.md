# Smart_Cities

This project takes advantage of my previous experiance as a Professional Engineer and incorperates the Data Analytics tools to solve real world problems in the world of designing smart cities

The data source I used is the ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II found [here](http://www.comfortdatabase.com/)

# Tools: 
GIS, CNNs, RNNs, Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Google Cloud, Rhino, CAD, Grasshopper

# Goals:
- Leveraged my civil engineering background to train an image classification tool that takes in a satellite aerial image and identifies key objects, boundaries, and junction points (such as curb, gutter, sidewalk, driveway, and building boundary) and communicates with the CAD software to draft these said boundaries
- Projected to automate 20% of a typical design engineer's workflow,  which will revolutionize the civil engineering field and increase productivity
